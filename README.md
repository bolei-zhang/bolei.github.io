### Short Bio

I am an assistant professor of Computer Science Department at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I got my PhD degree from Nanjing University in 2016. After that, I joined IBM Research as a research scientist. Then I worked in JD AI lab for 2 years. In June. 2020, I joined NJUPT. My research work mainly focuses on AI+IoT, data mining, machine learning and reinforcement learning.

I am looking for well motivated undergraduated students. Please contact us by email.
